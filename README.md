# MedBlueSGen 
### A population genetic study on Mediterranean blue shark for stock identification and conservation
This is the repository for all the codes used for the EU-JRC funded [MedBlueSGen](https://sustainable-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/fisheries-genetics/projects-fisheries-genetics/medbluesgen_en) project and from the paper by Leone et al., 2023 "**Population genomics of the blue shark, *Prionace glauca*, reveals different stock units and discrete populations in the Mediterranean Sea and the North East Atlantic**" *Evolutionary Applications*, 17(9): X-X

An interactive sampling map is available [here](https://sustainable-fisheries.ec.europa.eu/fisheries-genetics/projects-fisheries-genetics/medbluesgen/dataset_en)

After optimized assembly and SNPs calling, the dataset has been filtered using many criteria.

[dDocent](https://www.ddocent.com/) steps and filtering can be found [here](https://github.com/leoneago/MedBlueSGen/tree/main/dDocent_pipeline) 

 The Rmarkdown file with post dDocent steps and Population Genetics analysis can be found [here](https://github.com/leoneago/MedBlueSGen/blob/main/R/MedBlueSGen_Rmarkdown.Rmd)
